#_Beep Boop Project

#### The purpose of this project is to create a basic "pizza menu" that will not only take the order, but calculate the total cost based on selections made, utilizing learned concepts such as Constructors and Prototypes. 11/8/2019

#### By _**Brett Cordell**

## Description
This application will take in the pizza order from the User, and calculate the costs of the pizza by size, and toppings chosen. The user has the ability to select from a few toppings and sizes. Each topping, along with size will be stored, and repeated back to the user with a total cost based on size and toppings._

_Specs:
* User will choose Pizza Size and Toppings from provided options.
* Toppings are an additional $1 per topping.
* User can choose between two sizes. "Bigboi" starting at $20 and "SmallBoi" starting at $10.
* Order total his hidden until the order is submitted.
* Once the user has submitted, the "ordering" section will be removed, and only the order total, and a "reciept" will be displayed on the screen.
* User can click "start new order" to start over and create another pizza.

Expected Outcomes:


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone or download Git files provided.
* Open with desired Text editor (I used Atom).
* Set-up your own repositories, and branches to edit and add as needed.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Java script.
* jQuery (v4.2.1).

This project was tasked to better continue exploration of prior CSS and HTML knowledge while further implementing JS and jQuery to the page to better enhance site functionality.

This project was a challenge to better practice, and implement the use of Constructors, and prototypes to better calculate costs, and manipulate keys within an Object.
